Many practical problems can be posed in terms of generalizations of the multi-armed bandit. For example, the [Hyperband](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization is based on the multi-armed bandit with an infinite number of arms.\n\nIn Part 2, you'll implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm which use a neural network to generalize over states.\n\n## Readings\n\n- [Spinning Up in Deep RL Part 1: Key Concepts in RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html)\n    - Introduces the terminology and key concepts in RL.

Gym was released in 2016 and details of the API have changed significantly over the years. We are using version 0.23.1, so ensure that any documentation you use refers to the same version.\n\nBelow, we've provided a simple environment for the multi-armed bandit described in the Sutton and Barto reading. Here, an action is an integer indicating the choice of arm to pull, and an observation is the constant integer 0, since there's nothing to observe here. Even though the agent does in some sense observe the reward, the reward is always a separate variable from the observation.\n\nWe're using NumPy for this section. PyTorch provides GPU support and autograd, neither of which is of any use to environment code or the code we're writing today.\n\nRead the `MultiArmedBandit` code carefully and make sure you understand how the Gym environment API works.\n\n### The `info` dictionary\n\nThe environment's `step` method returns four values: `obs`, `reward`, `done`, and the `info` dictionary.\n\n`info` can contain anything extra that doesn't fit into the uniform interface - it's up to the environment what to put into it. A good use of this is for debugging information that the agent isn't \"supposed\" to see. In this case, we'll return the index of the actual best arm. This would allow us to measure how often the agent chooses the best arm, but it would also allow us to build a \"cheating\" agent that peeks at this information to make its decision.\n\nCheating agents are helpful because we know that they should obtain the maximum possible rewards; if they aren't, then there's a bug.\n\n### The `render()` method\n\nRender is only used for debugging or entertainment, and what it does is up to the environment. It might render a little popup window showing the Atari game, or it might give you a RGB image tensor, or just some ASCII text describing what's happening. In this case, we'll just make a little plot showing the distribution of rewards for each arm of the bandit.\n\n### Observation and Action Types\n\nA `gym.Env` is a generic type: both the type of the observations and the type of the actions depends on the specifics of the environment.\n\nWe're only dealing with the simplest case: a discrete set of actions which are the same in every state. In general, the actions could be continuous, or depend on the state.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "ObsType = int\nActType = int\n\n\nclass MultiArmedBandit(gym.Env):\n    action_space: gym.spaces.Discrete\n    observation_space: gym.spaces.Discrete\n    num_arms: int\n    stationary: bool\n    arm_reward_means: np.ndarray\n    arm_star: int\n\n    def __init__(self, num_arms=10, stationary=True):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_arms = num_arms\n        self.stationary = stationary\n        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(1)\n        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Discrete(num_arms)\n        self.reset()\n\n    def step(self, arm: ActType) -> tuple[ObsType, float, bool, dict]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Note: some documentation references a new style which has (termination, truncation) bools in place of the done bool.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        assert self.action_space.contains(arm)\n        if not self.stationary:\n            q_drift = self.np_random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.01, size=self.num_arms)\n            self.arm_reward_means += q_drift\n            self.best_arm = int(np.argmax(self.arm_reward_means))\n        reward = self.np_random.normal(loc=self.arm_reward_means[arm], scale=1.0)\n        obs = 0\n        done = False\n        info = dict(best_arm=self.best_arm)\n        return (obs, reward, done, info)\n\n    def reset(\n        self, seed: Optional[int] = None, return_info=False, options=None\n    ) -> Union[ObsType, tuple[ObsType, dict]]:\n        super().reset(seed=seed)\n        if self.stationary:\n            self.arm_reward_means = self.np_random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=self.num_arms)\n        else:\n            self.arm_reward_means = np.zeros(shape=[self.num_arms])\n        self.best_arm = int(np.argmax(self.arm_reward_means))\n        if return_info:\n            return (0, dict())\n        else:\n            return 0\n\n    def render(self, mode=\"human\"):\n        assert mode == \"human\", f\"Mode {mode} not supported!\"\n        bandit_samples = []\n        for arm in range(self.action_space.n):\n            bandit_samples += [np.random.normal(loc=self.arm_reward_means[arm], scale=1.0, size=1000)]\n        plt.violinplot(bandit_samples, showmeans=True)\n        plt.xlabel(\"Bandit Arm\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"Reward Distribution\")\n        plt.show()\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n### Registering an Environment\n\nUser code normally won't use the constructor of an `Env` directly for two reasons:\n\n- Usually, we want to wrap our `Env` in one or more wrapper classes.\n- If we want to test our agent on a variety of environments, it's annoying to have to import all the `Env` classes directly.\n\nThe `register` function stores information about our `Env` in a registry so that a later call to `gym.make` can look it up using the `id` string that is passed in.\n\nBy convention, the `id` strings have a suffix with a version number. There can be multiple versions of the \"same\" environment with different parameters, and benchmarks should always report the version number for a fair comparison. For instance, `id=\"ArmedBanditTestbed-v0\"` below.\n\n### TimeLimit Wrapper\n\nAs defined, our environment never terminates; the `done` flag is always False so the agent would keep playing forever. By setting `max_episode_steps` here, we cause our env to be wrapped in a `TimeLimit` wrapper class which terminates the episode after that number of steps.\n\nNote that the time limit is also an essential part of the problem definition: if it were larger or shorter, there would be more or less time to explore, which means that different algorithms (or at least different hyperparameters) would then have improved performance.\n\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "gym.envs.registration.register(\n    id=\"ArmedBanditTestbed-v0\",\n    entry_point=MultiArmedBandit,\n    max_episode_steps=max_episode_steps,\n    nondeterministic=True,\n    reward_threshold=1.0,\n    kwargs={\"num_arms\": 10, \"stationary\": True},\n)\nif MAIN:\n    env = gym.make(\"ArmedBanditTestbed-v0\")\n    print(\"Our env inside its wrappers looks like: \", env)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n### A Note on (pseudo) RNGs\n\nThe PRNG that `gym.Env` provides as `self.np_random` is from the [PCG family](https://www.pcg-random.org/index.html). In RL code, you often need massive quantities of pseudorandomly generated numbers, so it's important to have a generator that is both very fast and has good quality output.\n\nWhen you call `np.random.randint` or similar, you're using the old-school Mersenne Twister algorithm which is both slower and has inferior quality output to PCG. Since Numpy 1.17, you can use `np.random.default_rng()` to get a PCG generator and then use its `integers` method to get random integers.\n\n- Implement the `RandomAgent` subclass which should pick an arm at random.\n    - This is useful as a baseline to ensure the environment has no bugs. If your later agents are doing worse than random, you have a bug!\n- Verify that `RandomAgent` pulls the optimal arm with frequency roughly `1/num_arms`.\n- Verify that the average reward is very roughly zero. This is the case since the mean reward for each arm is centered on zero.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "class Agent:\n    \"\"\"Base class for agents in a multi-armed bandit environment (you do not need to add any implementation here)\"\"\"\n\n    rng: np.random.Generator\n\n    def __init__(self, num_arms: int, seed: int):\n        self.num_arms = num_arms\n        self.reset(seed)\n\n    def get_action(self) -> ActType:\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n    def observe(self, action: ActType, reward: float, info: dict) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self, seed: int) -> None:\n        self.rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n\n\ndef run_episode(env: gym.Env, agent: Agent, seed: int):\n    (rewards, was_best) = ([], [])\n    env.reset(seed=seed)\n    agent.reset(seed=seed)\n    done = False\n    while not done:\n        arm = agent.get_action()\n        (obs, reward, done, info) = env.step(arm)\n        agent.observe(arm, reward, info)\n        rewards.append(reward)\n        was_best.append(1 if arm == info[\"best_arm\"] else 0)\n    rewards = np.array(rewards, dtype=float)\n    was_best = np.array(was_best, dtype=int)\n    return (rewards, was_best)\n\n\ndef test_agent(env: gym.Env, agent: Agent, n_runs=200):\n    all_rewards = []\n    all_was_bests = []\n    for seed in tqdm(range(n_runs)):\n        (rewards, corrects) = run_episode(env, agent, seed)\n        all_rewards.append(rewards)\n        all_was_bests.append(corrects)\n    return (np.array(all_rewards), np.array(all_was_bests))\n\n\nclass RandomAgent(Agent):\n    def get_action(self) -> ActType:\n        pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    \"TODO: YOUR CODE HERE\"\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n### Reward Averaging\n\nNow implement these features as detailed in Sutton and Barto section 2.3, titled \"Incremental Implementation\":\n\n- Track the moving average of observed reward for each arm.\n- Epsilon greedy exploration: with probability `epsilon`, take a random action; otherwise take the action with the highest average observed reward.\n- Optimistic initial values: initialize each arm's reward estimate with the `optimism` value.\n\nRemember to call `super().__init__(num_arms, seed)` in your `__init__()` method.\n<details>\n<summary>Hint: Average reward formula</summary>\n\n$$Q_k = Q_{k-1} + \\frac{1}{k}[R_k - Q_{k-1}]$$\n\nWhere $k$ is the number of times the action has been taken, $R_k$ is the reward from the kth time the action was taken, and $Q_{k-1}$ is the average reward from the previous times this action was taken (this notation departs slightly from the S&B notation, but may be more helpful for our implementation).\n</details>\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def plot_rewards(all_rewards: np.ndarray):\n    (n_runs, n_steps) = all_rewards.shape\n    (fig, ax) = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 5))\n    ax.plot(all_rewards.mean(axis=0), label=\"Mean over all runs\")\n    quantiles = np.quantile(all_rewards, [0.05, 0.95], axis=0)\n    ax.fill_between(range(n_steps), quantiles[0], quantiles[1], alpha=0.5)\n    ax.set(xlabel=\"Step\", ylabel=\"Reward\")\n    ax.axhline(0, color=\"red\", linewidth=1)\n    fig.legend()\n    return fig\n\n\nclass RewardAveraging(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, num_arms: int, seed: int, epsilon: float, optimism: float):\n        pass\n\n    def get_action(self):\n        pass\n\n    def observe(self, action, reward, info):\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self, seed: int):\n        pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    env = gym.make(\"ArmedBanditTestbed-v0\", num_arms=num_arms, stationary=stationary)\n    regular_reward_averaging = RewardAveraging(num_arms, 0, epsilon=0.1, optimism=0)\n    (all_rewards, all_corrects) = test_agent(env, regular_reward_averaging, n_runs=N_RUNS)\n    print(f\"Frequency of correct arm: {all_corrects.mean()}\")\n    print(f\"Average reward: {all_rewards.mean()}\")\n    fig = plot_rewards(all_rewards)\n    optimistic_reward_averaging = RewardAveraging(num_arms, 0, epsilon=0.1, optimism=5)\n    (all_rewards, all_corrects) = test_agent(env, optimistic_reward_averaging, n_runs=N_RUNS)\n    print(f\"Frequency of correct arm: {all_corrects.mean()}\")\n    print(f\"Average reward: {all_rewards.mean()}\")\n    plot_rewards(all_rewards)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## Cheater Agent\n\nImplement the cheating agent and see how much reward it can get.

I had a bug in my first attempt that made both versions appear to perform equally, and there were only 13 lines of code, and I had written similar code before.\n\nThe number of hyperparameters also grows rapidly, and hyperparameters have interactions with each other. Even in this simple problem, we already have two different ways to encourage exploration (`epsilon` and `optimism`), and it's not clear whether it's better to use one or the other, or both in some combination. It's actually worse than that, because `epsilon` should probably be annealed down at some rate.\n\nEven in this single comparison, we trained 200 agents for each version. Is that a big number or a small number to estimate the effect size? Probably we should like, compute some statistics? And test with a different number of arms - maybe we need more exploration for more arms? The time needed for a rigorous evaluation is going to increase quickly.\n\nWe're using 0.23.1 of `gym`, which is not the latest version. 0.24.0 and 0.24.1 according to the [release notes](https://github.com/openai/gym/releases) have \"large bugs\" and the maintainers \"highly discourage using these releases\". How confident are we in the quality of the library code we're relying on?\n\nAs we continue onward to more complicated algorithms, keep an eye out for small discrepancies or minor confusions. Look for opportunities to check and cross-check everything, and be humble with claims.\n\n## UCBActionSelection\n\nOnce you feel good about your `RewardAveraging` implementation, implement `UCBActionSelection`.\n\nThis should store the same moving average rewards for each action as `RewardAveraging` did, but instead of taking actions using the epsilon-greedy strategy it should use Equation 2.8 in Section 2.6 to select actions using the upper confidence bound. It's also useful to add a small epsilon term to the $N_t(a)$ term, to handle instances where some of the actions haven't been taken yet.\n\nYou should expect to see a small improvement over `RewardAveraging` using this strategy.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "class UCBActionSelection(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, num_arms: int, seed: int, c: float):\n        pass\n\n    def get_action(self):\n        pass\n\n    def observe(self, action, reward, info):\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self, seed: int):\n        pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    env = gym.make(\"ArmedBanditTestbed-v0\", num_arms=num_arms, stationary=stationary)\n    ucb = UCBActionSelection(num_arms, 0, c=2.0)\n    (all_rewards, all_corrects) = test_agent(env, ucb, n_runs=N_RUNS)\n    print(f\"Frequency of correct arm: {all_corrects.mean()}\")\n    print(f\"Average reward: {all_rewards.mean()}\")\n    plot_rewards(all_rewards)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n### Tabular Methods\n\nThe methods used here are called tabular methods, because they create a lookup table from `(state, action)` to the Q value. This is pure memorization, and if our reward function was sampled from the space of all functions, this is usually the best you can do because there's no structure that you can exploit to do better.\n\nWe can hope to do better on most \"natural\" reward functions that do have structure. For example in a game of poker, there is structure in both of the actions (betting $100 will have a similar reward to betting $99 or $101), and between states (having a pair of threes in your hand is similar to having a pair of twos or fours). We need to take advantage of this, otherwise there are just too many states and actions to have any hope of training an agent.\n\nOne idea is to use domain knowledge to hand-code a function that \"buckets\" states or actions into a smaller number of equivalence classes and use those as the states and actions in a smaller version of the problem. This was one component in the RL agent [Libratus: The Superhuman AI for No-Limit Poker](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf). The details are beyond the scope of today's material, but I found them fascinating.\n\nIf you don't have domain knowledge to leverage, or you care specifically about making your algorithm \"general\", you can follow the approach that we'll be using in Part 2: make a neural network that takes in a state (technically, an observation) and outputs a value for each action.\n\n## On To Part 2\n\nMove on to part 2 for now - if you have time and interest at the end of the day, you can return and work on the bonus material.\n\n\n## Bonus\n\n- Implement the gradient bandit algorithm.\n- Implement an environment and an agent for the contextual bandit problem.\n- Complete the exercises at the end of Chapter 2 of Sutton and Barto.\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.15"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
