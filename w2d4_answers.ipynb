Mechanistic interpretability is the study of taking trained neural networks and reverse engineering the algorithms they've learned. It still somewhat surprises me that this is actually possible, but there are pretty strong indications that networks actually learn interpretable algorithms and that with effort and the right techniques these can be reverse engineered. There are two broad parts of this effort - finding ways to interpret the activations within a network as meaningful features (e.g. [that ResNet neurons often represent meaningful concepts](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)), and understanding the algorithms learned by the weights to create these features (often referred to as circuits).\n\nI (Neel) think this is a really important subfield of alignment. It seems like there are a lot of different ways that actually understanding what's going on inside models could help the development of AGI to go better for the world ([here's a list that I made](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uK6sQCNMw8WKzJeCQ/a-longlist-of-theories-of-impact-for-interpretability)). I'm personally most excited about using them to detect deception or inner misalignment in models, which might be near impossible to detect using purely input and output based methods.\n\nThe focus today and tomorrow will be on mechanistic interpretability of transformers. Today will mostly be spent reading and understanding the Anthropic paper [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html), which builds a mathematical framework for understanding the internal mechanisms of attention-only transformers (ie no MLPs) and conceptually how to break it down into (hopefully) interpretable chunks. The morning will be spent reading it **(please check my annotated table of contents below before reading!)**, and the afternoon spent going through some exercises clarifying and demonstrating the ideas in the paper, followed by your choice of interpreting small attention-only models and trying to replicate the results in the paper and looking for circuits in GPT-2.\n\nA note: This an extremely young and pre-paradigmatic field! Mechanistic interpretability of transformers has only really been a thing for the past year and a half. There are a ton of fascinating open questions, and room to contribute to the field! Personally, it deeply offends me that there exist computer programs like GPT-3 that can basically speak English at a human level, but that we have no idea how they work and could not code up such programs ourselves.\n\n# Reading Transformer Circuits\n\nThe goal for the morning is to:\n1. Review the below notes and table of contents for the paper before reading it\n2. Skim the reading tips below, making a mental note to refer back as needed\n3. Read and understand the paper: [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html)\n\nThere are a bunch of subtle but key ideas in here, and I recommend regularly stopping to practice explaining bits of the paper to your partner and vice versa, and seeing if you're on the same page. I (Neel) was an author on the paper and will be hanging out in the main room all morning to answer questions - feel free to read in there or come over and ask me things.\n\nThe following is an annotated table of contents to sections of the paper. **Bold** means the section is important, normal means it's worth reading but not essential, and *italics* means skip. **I recommend prioritising the bold sections and what feels interesting to you over fully reading through in order** (though you may need to backtrack in case you skip key definitions or details). The table of contents is followed by a list of tips for understanding the content, which it's worth skimming over before reading and coming back to when you reach the relevant section (though some won't make sense until you've read the paper, so don't spend too much time on this).\n\n## Annotated Table of Contents of the Paper\n\n* **[Introduction](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html)**\n* **[Summary of Results](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#summary-of-results)**\n* **[Transformer Overview](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#transformer-overview)** **(Most important section!)**\n* [Zero-Layer Transformers](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#zero-layer-transformers)\n* [One-Layer Attention-Only Transformers](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#one-layer-attention-only-transformers)\n    * [The Path Expansion Trick](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#1l-path-expansion)\n    * **[Splitting Attention Head terms into Query-Key and Output-Value Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#splitting-attention-head-terms-into-circuits)**\n    * **[Interpretation as Skip-Trigrams](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#interpretation-as-skip-trigrams)**\n    * [*Summarizing OV/QK Matrices*](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#summarizing-ovqk-matrices) (Skip, somewhat convoluted and mathsy and doesn't really generalise)\n    * [Do We \"Fully Understand\" One-Layer Models?](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#do-we-fully-understand-one-layer-models)\n* [Two-Layer Attention-Only Transformers](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#two-layer-attention-only-transformers)\n    * **[Three Kinds of Composition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#three-kinds-of-composition)**\n    * **[Path Expansion of Logits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#path-expansion-of-logits)**\n    * [*Path Expansion of Attention Scores QK Circuit*](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#path-expansion-of-attention-scores-qk-circuit) (Skip, v convoluted & mathsy)\n    * **[Analyzing a Two-Layer Model](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#analyzing-a-two-layer-model)**\n    * **[Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#induction-heads)**\n    * [Term Importance Analysis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#term-importance-analysis)\n    * [Virtual Attention Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#virtual-attention-heads)\n* [Where Does This Leave Us?](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#where-does-this-leave-us)\n* [*Related Work*](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#related-work)\n* [Additional Intuitions](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#additional-intuition)\n    * **[MLP Layers](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#additional-intuition:~:text=Intuition%20and%20Observations-,MLP%20Layers,-This%20article%20has)**\n\n## Tips & Insights for Reading the Paper\n* The eigenvalue stuff is very cool, but doesn't generalise that much, it's not a priority to get your head around\n* It's really useful to keep clear in your head the difference between parameters (learned numbers that are intrinsic to the network and independent of the inputs) and activations (temporary numbers calculated during a forward pass, that are functions of the input).\n    * Attention is a slightly weird thing - it's an activation, but is also used in a matrix multiplication with another activation (z), which makes it parameter-y.\n        * The idea of freezing attention patterns disentangles this, and lets us treat it as parameters.\n* The residual stream is the fundamental object in a transformer - each layer just applies incremental updates to it - this is really useful to keep in mind throughout!\n    * This is in contrast to a classic neural network, where each layer's output is the central object\n    * To underscore this, a funky result about transformers is that the aspect ratio isn't *that* important - if you increase d_model/n_layer by a factor of 10 from optimal for a 1.5B transformer (ie controlling for the number of parameters), then loss decreases by <1%.\n* The calculation of attention is a bilinear form (ie via the QK circuit) - for any pair of positions it takes an input vector from each and returns a scalar (so a ctx x ctx tensor for the entire sequence), while the calculation of the output of a head pre weighting by attention (ie via the OV circuit) is a linear map from the residual stream in to the residual stream out - the weights have the same shape, but are doing functions of completely different type signatures!\n* How to think about attention: A framing I find surprisingly useful is that attention is the \"wiring\" of the neural network. If we hold the attention patterns fixed, they tell the model how to move information from place to place, and thus help it be effective at sequence prediction. But the key interesting thing about a transformer is that attention is *not* fixed - attention is computed and takes a substantial fraction of the network's parameters, allowing it to dynamically set the wiring. This can do pretty meaningful computation, as we see with induction heads, but is in some ways pretty limited. In particular, if the wiring is fixed, an attention only transformer is a purely linear map! Without the ability to intelligently compute attention, an attention-only transformer would be incredibly limited, and even with it it's highly limited in the functional forms it can represent.\n    * Another angle - attention as generalised convolution. A naive transformer would use 1D convolutions on the sequence. This is basically just attention patterns that are hard coded to be uniform over the last few tokens - since information is often local, this is a decent enough default wiring. Attention allows the model to devote some parameters to compute more intelligent wiring, and thus for a big enough and good enough model will significantly outperform convolutions.\n* One of the key insights of the framework is that there are only a few activations of the network that are intrinsically meaningful and interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and attention patterns (and neuron activations in non-attention-only models). Everything else (the residual stream, queries, keys, values, etc) are just intermediate states on a calculation between two intrinsically meaningful things, and you should instead try to understand the start and the end. Our main goal is to decompose the network into many paths between interpretable start and end states\n    * We can get away with this because transformers are really linear! The composition of many linear components is just one enormous matrix\n* A really key thing to grok about attention heads is that the QK and OV circuits act semi-independently. The QK circuit determines which previous tokens to attend to, and the OV circuit determines what to do to tokens *if* they are attended to. In particular, the residual stream at the destination token *only* determines the query and thus what tokens to attend to - what the head does *if* it attends to a position is independent of the destination token residual stream (other than being scaled by the attention pattern).\n    <p align=\"center\">\n        <img src=\"w2d4_Attn_Head_Pic.png\" width=\"400\" />\n    </p>\n* Skip trigram bugs are a great illustration of this - it's worth making sure you really understand them. The key idea is that the destination token can *only* choose what tokens to pay attention to, and otherwise not mediate what happens *if* they are attended to. So if multiple destination tokens want to attend to the same source token but do different things, this is impossible - the ability to choose the attention pattern is insufficient to mediate this.\n    * Eg, keep...in -> mind is a legit skip trigram, as is keep...at -> bay, but keep...in -> bay is an inherent bug from this pair of skip trigrams\n* The tensor product notation looks a lot more complicated than it is. $A \\otimes W$ is shorthand for \"the function $f_{A,W}$ st $f_{A,W}(x)=AxW$\" - I recommend mentally substituting this in in your head everytime you read it.\n* K, Q and V composition are really important and fairly different concepts! I think of each attention head as a circuit component with 3 input wires (Q,K,V) and a single output wire (O). Composition looks like connecting up wires, but each possible connection is a choice! The key, query and value do different things and so composition does pretty different things.\n    * Q-Composition, intuitively, says that we want to be more intelligent in choosing our destination token - this looks like us wanting to move information to a token based on *that* token's context. A natural example might be the final token in a several token word or phrase, where earlier tokens are needed to disambiguate it, eg E|iff|el| Tower|\n    * K-composition, intuitively, says that we want to be more intelligent in choosing our source token - this looks like us moving information *from* a token based on its context (or otherwise some computation at that token).\n        * Induction heads are a clear example of this - the source token only matters because of what comes before it!\n    * V-Composition, intuitively, says that we want to *route* information from an earlier source token *other than that token's value* via the current destination token. It's less obvious to me when this is relevant, but could imagine eg a network wanting to move information through several different places and collate and process it along the way\n        * One example: In the ROME paper, we see that when models recall that \"The Eiffel Tower is in\" -> \" Paris\", it stores knowledge about the Eiffel Tower on the \" Tower\" token. When that information is routed to | in|, it must then map to the output logit for | Paris|, which seems likely due to V-Composition\n* A surprisingly unintuitive concept is the notion of heads (or other layers) reading and writing from the residual stream. These operations are *not* inverses! A better phrasing might be projecting vs embedding.\n    * Reading takes a vector from a high-dimensional space and *projects* it to a smaller one - (almost) any two pair of random vectors will have non-zero dot product, and so every read operation can pick up *somewhat* on everything in the residual stream. But the more a vector is aligned to the read subspace, the most that vector's norm (and intuitively, its information) is preserved, while other things are lower fidelity\n        * A common reaction to these questions is to start reasoning about null spaces, but I think this is misleading - rank and nullity are discrete concepts, while neural networks are fuzzy, continuous objects - nothing ever actually lies in the null space or has non-full rank (unless it's explicitly factored). I recommend thinking in terms of \"what fraction of information is lost\". The null space is the special region with fraction lost = 1\n    * Writing *embeds* a vector into a small dimensional subspace of a larger vector space. The overall residual stream is the sum of many vectors from many different small subspaces.\n        * Every read operation can see into every writing subspace, but will see some with higher fidelity, while others are noise it would rather ignore.\n    * It can be useful to reason about this by imagining that d_head=1, and that every vector is a random Gaussian vector - projecting a random Gaussian onto another in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ will preserve $\\frac{1}{n}$ of the variance, on average.\n* A key framing of transformers (and neural networks in general) is that they engage in **lossy compression** - they have a limited number of dimensions and want to fit in more directions than they have dimensions. Each extra dimension introduces some interference, but has the benefit of having more expressibility. Neural networks will learn an optimal-ish solution, and so will push the compression as far as it can until the costs of interference dominate.\n    * This is clearest in the case of QK and OV circuits - $W_QK=W_Q^TW_K$ is a d_model x d_model matrix with rank d_head. And to understand the attention circuit, it's normally best to understand $W_QK$ on its own. Often, the right mental move is to forget that $W_QK$ is low rank, to understand what the ideal matrix to learn here would be, and then to assume that the model learns the best low rank factorisation of that.\n        * This is another reason to not try to interpret the keys and queries - the intermediate state of a low rank factorisations are often a bit of a mess because everything is so compressed (though if you can do SVD on $W_QK$ that may get you a meaningful basis?)\n        * Rough heuristic for thinking about low rank factorisations and how good they can get - a good way to produce one is to take the SVD and zero out all but the first d_head singular values.\n    * This is the key insight behind why polysemanticity (back from w1d5) is a thing and is a big deal - naturally the network would want to learn one feature per neuron, but it in fact can learn to compress more features than total neurons. It has some error introduced from interference, but this is likely worth the cost of more compression.\n        * Just as we saw there, the sparsity of features is a big deal for the model deciding to compress things! Inteference cost goes down the more features are sparse (because unrelated features are unlikely to co-occur) while expressibility benefits don't really change that much.\n    * The residual stream is the central example of this - every time two parts of the network compose, they will be communicating intermediate states via the residual stream. Bandwidth is limited, so these will likely try to each be low rank. And the directions within that intermediate product will *only* make sense in the context of what the writing and reading components care about. So interpreting the residual stream seems likely fucked - it's just\n* The 'the residual stream is fundamentally uninterpretable' claim is somewhat overblown - most models do dropout on the residual stream which somewhat privileges that basis\n    * And there are [*weird*](https://timdettmers.com/2022/08/17/llm-int8-and-emergent-features/) results about funky directions in the residual stream.\n* Getting your head around the idea of a privileged basis is very worthwhile! The key mental move is to flip between \"a vector is a direction in a geometric space\" and \"a vector is a series of numbers in some meaningful basis, where each number is intrinsically meaningful\". By default, it's easy to spend too much time in the second mode, because every vector is represented as a series of numbers within the GPU, but this is often less helpful!\n\n<details>\n<summary>An aside on why we need the tensor product notation at all</summary>\n\nNeural networks are functions, and are built up of several subcomponents (like attention heads) that are also functions - they are defined by how they take in an input and return an output. But when doing interpretability we want the ability to talk about the network as a function intrinsically and analyse the structure of this function, *not* in the context of taking in a specific input and getting a specific output. And this means we need a language that allows us to naturally talk about functions that are the sum (components acting in parallel) or composition (components acting in series) of other functions.\n\nA simple case of this: We're analysing a network with several linear components acting in parallel - component $C_i$ is the function $x \\rightarrow W_ix$, and can be represented intrinsically as $W_i$ (matrices are equivalent to linear maps). We can represent the layer with all acting in parallel as $x \\rightarrow \\sum_i W_ix=(\\sum_i W_i)x$, and so intrinsically as $\\sum_i W_i$ - this is easy because matrix notation is designed to make addition of.\n\nAttention heads are harder because they map the input tensor $x$ (shape: `[position x d_model]`) to an output $Ax(W_OW_V)^T$ - this is a linear function, but now on a *tensor*, so we can't trivially represent addition and composition with matrix notation. The paper uses the notation $A\\otimes W_OW_V$, but this is just different notation for the same underlying function. The output of the layer is the sum over the 12 heads: $\\sum_i A^{(i)}x(W_O^{(i)}W_V^{(i)})^T$. And so we could represent the function of the entire layer as $\\sum_i A^{(i)} x (W_O^{(i)}W_V^{(i)})$. There are natural extensions of this notation for composition, etc, though things get much more complicated when reasoning about attention patterns - this is now a bilinear function of a pair of inputs: the query and key residual streams. (Note that $A$ is also a function of $x$ here, in a way that isn't obvious from the notation.)\n\nThe key point to remember is that if you ever get confused about what a tensor product means, explicitly represent it as a function of some input and see if things feel clearer.\n</details>\n\n# Rest of the Day\n\n\nWe're going to spend the rest of the day analysing our very own 2L Attn-Only model. We're going to first validate some of the paper's claims about ways to understand attention heads, then build some rudimentary interpretability tooling, and finally use this tooling to reverse engineer the induction heads learned by the model.\n\n**Meta:** The main goal of the above structure is to help you really understand the ideas in the paper, and to practice careful and rigorous reverse engineering of a circuit. But more generally, the main thing I want to convey today is that interpreting models is tractable, and that they can actually be understood! (And hopefully, that this is exciting and fascinating!) If that structure doesn't sound exciting to you, feel free to skip around, and I give some tips and infrastructure at the end for looking for circuits in GPT-2 - feel free to just skip to that if you ever get bored! If you do skip ahead, I recommend copying code from the solutions file, as some of the functions we define here may be pretty useful.\n\n**Meta 2:** I leave a lot of random asides and exercises in here, based on concepts I think are cute or useful. I think it'd take more time than a day to go through them all, and recommend skipping/having a low bar for looking up solutions/following your curiosity.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!-- TOC -->\n\n- [Introduction](#introduction)\n- [Reading Transformer Circuits](#reading-transformer-circuits)\n    - [Annotated Table of Contents of the Paper](#annotated-table-of-contents-of-the-paper)\n    - [Tips & Insights for Reading the Paper](#tips--insights-for-reading-the-paper)\n- [Rest of the Day](#rest-of-the-day)\n    - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n- [Introducing Our Toy Attention-Only Model](#introducing-our-toy-attention-only-model)\n- [Hook Points](#hook-points)\n- [Understanding Attention Heads](#understanding-attention-heads)\n    - [QK-Circuits](#qk-circuits)\n- [Building Interpretability Tools](#building-interpretability-tools)\n    - [Direct Logit attribution](#direct-logit-attribution)\n    - [Visualising Attention Patterns](#visualising-attention-patterns)\n    - [Summarising attention patterns](#summarising-attention-patterns)\n    - [Ablations](#ablations)\n    - [Finding Induction Circuits](#finding-induction-circuits)\n    - [Checking for the induction capability](#checking-for-the-induction-capability)\n    - [Looking for Induction Attention Patterns](#looking-for-induction-attention-patterns)\n        - [Logit Attribution](#logit-attribution)\n    - [Ablations](#ablations)\n    - [Previous Token Head](#previous-token-head)\n    - [Mechanistic Analysis of Induction Circuits](#mechanistic-analysis-of-induction-circuits)\n        - [Reverse Engineering OV-Circuit Analysis](#reverse-engineering-ov-circuit-analysis)\n        - [Reverse Engineering Positional Embeddings + Prev Token Head](#reverse-engineering-positional-embeddings--prev-token-head)\n        - [Composition Analysis](#composition-analysis)\n            - [Splitting activations](#splitting-activations)\n            - [Interpreting the K-Composition Circuit](#interpreting-the-k-composition-circuit)\n    - [Further Exploration of Induction Circuits](#further-exploration-of-induction-circuits)\n        - [Composition scores](#composition-scores)\n            - [Setting a Baseline](#setting-a-baseline)\n            - [Theory + Efficient Implementation](#theory--efficient-implementation)\n            - [Targeted Ablations](#targeted-ablations)\n- [Bonus](#bonus)\n    - [Looking for Circuits in Real LLMs](#looking-for-circuits-in-real-llms)\n    - [Training Your Own Toy Models](#training-your-own-toy-models)\n    - [Interpreting Induction Heads During Training](#interpreting-induction-heads-during-training)\n\n<!-- /TOC -->\n\n\n# Introducing Our Toy Attention-Only Model\n\nHere we introduce a toy 2L attention-only transformer trained specifically for today. Some changes to make them easier to interpret:\n- It has only attention blocks\n- The positional embeddings are only added to each key and query vector in the attention layers as opposed to the token embeddings (meaning that the residual stream can't directly encode positional information)\n  - This turns out to make it *way* easier for induction heads to form, it happens 2-3x times earlier - [see the comparison of two training runs](https://wandb.ai/mechanistic-interpretability/attn-only/reports/loss_ewma-22-08-24-11-08-83---VmlldzoyNTI0MDMz?accessToken=8ap8ir6y072uqa4f9uinotdtrwmoa8d8k2je4ec0lyasf1jcm3mtdh37ouijgdbm) here. (The bump in each curve is the formation of induction heads)\n- It has no MLP layers, no LayerNorms, and no biases\n- There are separate embed and unembed matrices (ie the weights are not tied)\n- The activations in the attention layers $(q, k, v, z)$ have shape `[batch, position, head_index, d_head]` (ie, not flattened into a single d_model axis)\n  - Similarly $W_K, W_Q, W_V$ have shape `[head_index, d_head, d_model]`, $W_O$ has shape `[head_index, d_model, d_head]`\n- Convention: All weight matrices multiply on the left (ie have shape `[output, input]`)\n\nSee the model code in `w2d4_attn_only_transformer.py`\n\nHere are its specs:\n- `num_layers`: 2,\n- `num_heads`: 12,\n- `head_size`: 64, (`d_head` in Anthropic notation)\n- `hidden_size`: 768, (`d_model` in Anthropic notation)\n- `vocab_size`: 50259,\n- `max_position_embeddings`: 2048\n- GPT-NeoX tokenizer\n  - The tokenizer was adapted to add a special token to the start of each string, <|endoftext|>.

This means we can decompose the output logits into a term coming from each head and directly do attribution like this! Write a function to look at how much each head and the direct path term contributes to the correct logit.\n\n<details><summary>A concrete example</summary>\n\nLet's say that our model knows that the token Harry is followed by the token Potter, and we want to figure out how it does this. The logits on Harry are `W_U @ residual`. But this is a linear map, and the residual stream is the sum of all previous layers `residual = embed + attn_out_0 + attn_out_1`. So `logits = (W_U @ embed) + (W_U @ attn_out_0) + (W_U @ attn_out_1)`\n\nWe can be even more specific, and *just* look at the logit of the Potter token - this corresponds to a row of W_U, and so a direction in the residual stream - our logit is now a single number that is the sum of `(potter_U @ embed) + (potter_U @ attn_out_0) + (potter_U @ attn_out_1)`. Even better, we can decompose each attention layer output into the sum of the result of each head, and use this to get many terms.\n</details>\n\nCalculate the logit attributions of the following paths to the logits: direct path (via the residual connections from the embedding to unembedding); each layer 0 head (via the residual connection and skipping layer 1); each layer 1 head. To emphasise, these are not paths from the start to the end of the model, these are paths from the output of some component directly to the logits - we make no assumptions about how each path was calculated!\n\nNote: Here we are just looking at the DIRECT effect on the logits - if heads compose with other heads and affect logits like that, or inhibit logits for other tokens to boost the correct one we will not pick up on this!\n\nNote 2: By looking at just the logits corresponding to the correct token, our data is much lower dimensional because we can ignore all other tokens other than the correct next one (Dealing with a 50K vocab size is a pain!). But this comes at the cost of missing out on more subtle effects, like a head suppressing other plausible logits, to increase the log prob of the correct one.\n\nNote 3: When calculating correct output logits, we will get tensors with a dimension (position - 1,), not (position,) - we remove the final element of the output (logits), and the first element of labels (tokens). This is because we're predicting the *next* token, and we don't know the token after the final token, so we ignore it.\n\n<details><summary>Aside:</summary>\n\nWhile we won't worry about this for this exercise, logit attribution is often more meaningful if we first center W_U - ie, ensure the mean of each row writing to the output logits is zero. Log softmax is invariant when we add a constant to all the logits, so we want to control for a head that just increases all logits by the same amount. We won't do this here for ease of testing.</details>\n\n<details><summary>Exercise: Why don't we do this to the log probs instead?</summary>\n\nA: Because log probs aren't linear, they go through log_softmax, a non-linear function.</details>\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def to_numpy(tensor):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to convert things to numpy before plotting with Plotly.\"\"\"\n    return tensor.detach().cpu().numpy()\n\n\ndef convert_tokens_to_string(tokens, batch_index=0):\n    if len(tokens.shape) == 2:\n        tokens = tokens[batch_index]\n    return [f\"|{tokenizer.decode(tok)}|_{c}\" for (c, tok) in enumerate(tokens)]\n\n\ndef plot_logit_attribution(logit_attr, tokens):\n    tokens = tokens.squeeze()\n    y_labels = convert_tokens_to_string(tokens[:-1])\n    x_labels = [\"Direct\"] + [f\"L{l}H{h}\" for l in range(cfg[\"n_layers\"]) for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])]\n    px.imshow(\n        to_numpy(logit_attr),\n        x=x_labels,\n        y=y_labels,\n        labels={\"x\": \"Term\", \"y\": \"Position\", \"color\": \"logit\"},\n        color_continuous_midpoint=0.0,\n        color_continuous_scale=\"RdBu\",\n    ).show()\n\n\ndef logit_attribution(embed, l1_results, l2_results, W_U, tokens):\n    \"\"\"\n    We have provided 'W_U_to_logits' which is a (position, d_model) tensor where each row is the unembed for the correct NEXT token at the current position.\n\n    Inputs:\n        embed: (position, d_model)\n        l1_results: (position, head_index, d_model)\n        l2_results: (position, head_index, d_model)\n        W_U: (d_vocab, d_model)\n    Returns:\n        Tensor representing the concatenation (along dim=-1) of logit attributions from the direct path (position-1,1), layer 0 logits (position-1, n_heads) and layer 1 logits (position-1, n_heads).\n    \"\"\"\n    W_U_to_logits = W_U[tokens[1:], :]\n    \"TODO: YOUR CODE HERE\"\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    w2d4_test.test_logit_attribution(logit_attribution, model, cache_2, tokens_2, logits_2)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\nNow we can visualise the logit attributions for each path through the model.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "if MAIN:\n    batch_index = 0\n    embed = cache_2[\"hook_embed\"][batch_index]\n    l1_results = cache_2[\"blocks.0.attn.hook_result\"][batch_index]\n    l2_results = cache_2[\"blocks.1.attn.hook_result\"][batch_index]\n    logit_attr = logit_attribution(embed, l1_results, l2_results, model.unembed.W_U, tokens_2[batch_index])\n    plot_logit_attribution(logit_attr, tokens_2)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## Visualising Attention Patterns\n\nA key insight from the paper is that we should focus on interpreting the parts of the model that are intrinsically interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and the attention patterns.

You'll need two new concepts:\n* **Hook functions:** A hook function has the interface `def hook_fn(activation, hook)` and is associated with a particular activation. When the model is run, our hook function triggers, and is run on its activation. By default it just accesses the activation, but if the hook function edits the activation in place or returns a new one, the model then continues running with that new activation instead\n    * You can ignore the `hook` argument for now\n* We can temporarily add in a hook to a specific activation by defining this hook function, and then calling `logits = model.run_with_hooks(tokens, fwd_hooks=[(hook_name, hook_function)])`.

And are sufficiently interesting that we wrote [another paper just about them](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).\n\n<details><summary>An aside on why induction heads are a big deal</summary>\n\nThere's a few particularly striking things about induction heads:\n\n* They develop fairly suddenly in a phase change - from about 2B to 4B tokens we go from no induction heads to pretty well developed ones. This is a striking divergence from a 1L model [see the training curves for this model vs a 1L one](https://wandb.ai/mechanistic-interpretability/attn-only/reports/loss_ewma-22-08-24-11-08-65---VmlldzoyNTI0MDQx?accessToken=extt248d3qoxbqw1zy05kplylztjmx2uqaui3ctqb0zruem0tkpwrssq2ao1su3j) and can be observed in much larger models (eg a 13B one)\n    * Phase changes are particularly interesting (and depressing) from an alignment perspective, because the prospect of a sharp left turn, or emergent capabilities like deception or situational awareness seems like worlds where alignment may be harder, and we get caught by surprise without warning shots or simpler but analogous models to test our techniques on.\n\n* They are responsible for a significant loss decrease - so much so that there's a visible bump in the loss curve when they develop (this change in loss can be pretty comparable to the increase in loss from major increases in model size, though this is hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison)\n* They seem to be responsible for the vast majority of in-context learning - the ability to use far back tokens in the context to predict the next token. This is a significant way in which transformers outperform older architectures like RNNs or LSTMs, and induction heads seem to be a big part of this.\n* The same core circuit seems to be used in a bunch of more sophisticated settings, such as translation or few-shot learning - there are heads that seem clearly responsible for those *and* which double as induction heads\n\n</details>\n\nWe're going to spend the next two section applying the interpretability tools we just built to hunting down induction heads - first doing feature analysis to find the relevant heads and what they're doing, and then mechanistically reverse engineering the details of how the circuit works. I recommend you re-read the inductions head section of the paper or read [this intuitive explanation from Mary Phuong](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HY2xKDW6Pup_-XNXQBjoYbc2xFILz06uxHkk9-pYmY/edit), but in brief, the induction circuit consists of a previous token head in layer 0 and an induction head in layer 1, where the induction head learns to attend to the token immediately *after* copies of the current token via K-Composition with the previous token head.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"w2d4_Induction_Head_Pic.png\" width=\"400\" />\n</p>\n\n**Recommended Exercise:** Before continuing, take a few minutes to think about how you would implement an induction circuit if you were hand-coding the weights of an attention-only transformer:\n* How would you implement a copying head?\n* How would you implement a previous token head?\n* How would you implement an induction head?\n\n\n<details><summary>My summary of the algorithm</summary>\n\n* Head L0H7 is a previous token head (the QK-circuit ensures it always attends to the previous token).\n* The OV circuit of head L0H7 writes a copy of the previous token in a *different* subspace to the one used by the embedding.\n* The output of head L0H7 is used by the *key* input of head L1H4 via K-Composition to attend to 'the source token whose previous token is the destination token'.\n* The OV-circuit of head L1H4 copies the *value* of the source token to the same output logit\n    * Note that this is copying from the embedding subspace, *not* the L0H7 output subspace - it is not using V-Composition at all\n\nTo emphasise - the sophisticated hard part is computing the *attention* pattern of the induction head - this takes careful composition. The previous token and copying parts are fairly easy. This is a good illustrative example of how the QK circuits and OV circuits act semi-independently, and are often best thought of somewhat separately. And that computing the attention patterns can involve real and sophisticated computation!\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Exercise: Why couldn't an induction head form in a 1L model?</summary>\n\nBecause this would require a head which attends a key position based on the *value* of the token before it. Attention scores are just a function of the key token and the query token, and are not a function of other tokens.\nThe attention pattern *does* allow other tokens because of softmax - if another key token has a high attention score, softmax inhibits this pair. But this inhibition is symmetric across positions, so can't systematically favour the token *next* to the relevant one.\n\nNote that a key detail is that the value of adjacent tokens are (approximately) unrelated - if the model wanted to attend based on relative *position* this is easy.\n</details>\n\n\n## Checking for the induction capability\n\nA striking thing about models with induction heads is that, given a repeated sequence of random tokens, they can predict the repeated half of the sequence. This is nothing like it's training data, so this is kind of wild! The ability to predict this kind of out of distribution generalisation is a strong point of evidence that you've really understood a circuit.\n\nTo check that this model has induction heads, we're going to run it on exactly that, and compare performance on the two halves - you should see a striking difference in the per token losses\n\n<details><summary>Tips:</summary>\n\nRemember to include a cache called `rep_cache` and to reset the model hooks afterwards, and to include the prefix array at the start.

But there's a bunch more ideas that we can apply for finding circuits in networks that are fun to practice on induction heads, so here's some bonus content - feel free to skip to the later bonus ideas though.\n\n### Composition scores\n\nA particularly cool idea in the paper is the idea of [virtual weights](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#residual-comms), or compositional scores. (though I came up with it, so I'm deeply biased) This is used [to identify induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#analyzing-a-two-layer-model)\n\nThe key idea of compositional scores is that the residual stream is a large space, and each head is reading and writing from small subspaces. By defaults, any two heads will have little overlap between their subspaces (in the same way that any two random vectors have almost zero dot product in a large vector space). But if two heads are deliberately composing, then they will likely want to ensure they write and read from similar subspaces, so that minimal information is lost. As a result, we can just directly look at \"how much overlap there is\" between the output space of the earlier head and the K, Q, or V input space of the later head. We represent the output space with $W_OV=W_OW_V$, and the input space with $W_QK^T=W_K^TW_Q$ (for Q-composition), $W_QK=W_Q^TW_K$ (for K-Composition) or $W_OV=W_OW_V$ (for V-Composition, of the later head). Call these matrices $W_A$ and $W_B$ respectively.\n\nHow do we formalise overlap? This is basically an open question, but a surprisingly good metric is $\\frac{|W_BW_A|}{|W_B||W_A|}$ where $|W|=\\sum_{i,j}W_{i,j}^2$ is the Frobenius norm, the sum of squared elements. Let's calculate this metric for all pairs of heads in layer 0 and layer 1 for each of K, Q and V composition and plot it.\n\n<details><summary>Why do we use W_OV as the output weights, not W_O? (and W_QK not W_Q or W_K, etc)</summary>\n\nBecause W_O is arbitrary - we can apply an arbitrary invertible matrix to W_O and its inverse to W_V and preserve the product W_OV. Though in practice, it's an acceptable approximation.\n</details>\n\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def frobenius_norm(tensor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implicitly allows batch dimensions\n    \"\"\"\n    return tensor.pow(2).sum([-2, -1])\n\n\ndef get_q_comp_scores(W_QK, W_OV):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a layer_1_index x layer_0_index tensor, where the i,j th entry is the Q-Composition score from head L0Hj to L1Hi\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\ndef get_k_comp_scores(W_QK, W_OV):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a layer_1_index x layer_0_index tensor, where the i,j th entry is the K-Composition score from head L0Hj to L1Hi\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\ndef get_v_comp_scores(W_OV_1, W_OV_0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a layer_1_index x layer_0_index tensor, where the i,j th entry is the V-Composition score from head L0Hj to L1Hi\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    W_O = model.blocks[0].attn.W_O\n    W_V = model.blocks[0].attn.W_V\n    W_OV_0 = t.einsum(\"imh,ihM->imM\", W_O, W_V)\n    W_Q = model.blocks[1].attn.W_Q\n    W_K = model.blocks[1].attn.W_K\n    W_V = model.blocks[1].attn.W_V\n    W_O = model.blocks[1].attn.W_O\n    W_QK = t.einsum(\"ihm,ihM->imM\", W_Q, W_K)\n    W_OV_1 = t.einsum(\"imh,ihM->imM\", W_O, W_V)\n    q_comp_scores = get_q_comp_scores(W_QK, W_OV_0)\n    k_comp_scores = get_k_comp_scores(W_QK, W_OV_0)\n    v_comp_scores = get_v_comp_scores(W_OV_1, W_OV_0)\n    px.imshow(\n        to_numpy(q_comp_scores),\n        y=[f\"L1H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        x=[f\"L0H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        labels={\"x\": \"Layer 0\", \"y\": \"Layer 1\"},\n        title=\"Q Composition Scores\",\n        color_continuous_scale=\"Blues\",\n        zmin=0.0,\n    ).show()\n    px.imshow(\n        to_numpy(k_comp_scores),\n        y=[f\"L1H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        x=[f\"L0H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        labels={\"x\": \"Layer 0\", \"y\": \"Layer 1\"},\n        title=\"K Composition Scores\",\n        color_continuous_scale=\"Blues\",\n        zmin=0.0,\n    ).show()\n    px.imshow(\n        to_numpy(v_comp_scores),\n        y=[f\"L1H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        x=[f\"L0H{h}\" for h in range(cfg[\"n_heads\"])],\n        labels={\"x\": \"Layer 0\", \"y\": \"Layer 1\"},\n        title=\"V Composition Scores\",\n        color_continuous_scale=\"Blues\",\n        zmin=0.0,\n    ).show()\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n#### Setting a Baseline\n\nTo interpret the above graphs we need a baseline!

U and V are rotations and do not change norm, so |M|=|S|\n</details>\n\nSo if $W_A=U_AS_AV_A$, $W_B=U_BS_BV_B$, then $|W_A|=|S_A|$, $|W_B|=|S_B|$ and $|W_AW_B|=|S_AV_AU_BS_B|$. In some sense, $V_AU_B$ represents how aligned the subspaces written to and read from are, and the $S_A$ and $S_B$ terms weights by the importance of those subspaces.\n\nWe can also use this insight to write a more efficient way to calculate composition scores - this is extremely useful if you want to do this analysis at scale! The key is that we know that our matrices have a low rank factorisation, and it's much cheaper to calculate the SVD of a narrow matrix than one that's large in both dimensions.

It loads in an open source LLMs into a simplified transformer, and gives each activation a unique name. With this name, we can set a hook that accesses or edits that activation, with the same API that we've been using on our 2L Transformer.
