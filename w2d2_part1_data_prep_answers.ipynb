In our case we will be using the [IMDB Sentiment Classification Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n\nIt's traditional to treat this as a binary classification task where each review is positive or negative. Today we're also going to predict the star rating review from 1 to 10, inclusive.\n\nIt's a bit redundant to train with both the star rating and the positive/negative labels as targets (you could just use the star rating), but we'll do it anyway to practice having multiple terms in the loss function.\n\nThere are a few ways to treat the star rating. One way is to have each rating be a category and use the regular cross entropy loss.\n\nExercise: what are the disadvantages of doing this?\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution - disadvantages of cross-entropy for star rating</summary>\n\nCross entropy doesn't capture the intuition that the classes are ordered. Intuitively, we should penalize our model more for predicting 10 stars for a 1-star movie than predicting 2 stars.\n\n</details>\n\nAnother way would be to treat the star rating as a continuous value, and use mean squared or mean absolute error. We'll do this today because it's simple and works well, but note that a more sophisticated approach like [ordinal regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_regression) could also be used.\n\n### IMDB Dataset\n\nPreviously, we've used the `torchvision` package to download CIFAR10 for us. Today we'll load and process the training data ourselves to get an idea of what's involved.\n\nUse [requests.get](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/) to fetch the data and then write the `content` field of the response to disk. It's 82MB, so may take a few seconds depending on your connection. On future calls to the function, if the file already exists, your function should just read the local file instead of downloading the data again.\n\nWe've provided code that hashes the data using `hashlib.md5` and verifies that it matches a known good reference. Why is this a good practice?\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution - Why Hash the Data?</summary>\n\nWe don't expect the file pointed to by the URL to change, and if it does we would like things to break loudly. At the very least, our training pipeline would no longer be reproducible, and it's possible that an adversary compromised the website and is supplying malicious data of some form. It's also possible that hardware errors could corrupt the data either on our local disk or the remote machine.\n\n</details>\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def maybe_download(url: str, path: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Download the file from url and save it to path.

Remember: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\".\n\n### Basic Inspection\n\nTake some time now to do a basic inspection of your data. This should at minimum include:\n\n- Plot the distribution of review lengths in characters.\n    - Our BERT was only trained to handle 512 tokens maximum, so if we assume that a token is roughly 4 characters, we will have to truncate reviews that are longer than around 2048 characters.\n    - Are positive and negative reviews different in length on average? If so, truncating would differentially affect the longer reviews.\n- Plot the distribution of star ratings. Is it what you expected?\n\n<details>\n<summary>Star ratings distribution</summary>\nThat's right, there are no five or six star reviews in the dataset.\n</details>\n\n### Detailed Inspection\n\nEither now, or later while your model is training, it's a worthwhile and underrated activity to do a more in-depth inspection. For a language dataset, some things I would want to know are:\n\n- What is the distribution over languages? Many purportedly English datasets in fact have some of the data in other natural languages like Spanish, and computer languages like HTML tags.\n    - This can cause bias in the results. Suppose that a small fraction of reviews were in Spanish, and purely by chance they have more positive/negative sentiment than the base rate. Our classifier would then incorrectly learn that Spanish words inherently have positive/negative sentiment.\n    - Libraries like [Lingua](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua-py) can (imperfectly) check for this.\n- How are non-ASCII characters handled?\n    - The answer is often \"poorly\". A large number of things can go wrong around quoting, escaping, and various text encodings. Spending a lot of time trying to figure out why there are way too many backslashes in front of your quotation marks is an Authentic ML Experience. Libraries like [`ftfy`](https://pypi.org/project/ftfy/) can be useful here.\n- What data can you imagine existing that is NOT part of the dataset? Your neural network is not likely to generalize outside the specific distribution it was trained on. You need to understand the limitations of your trained classifier, and notice if you in fact need to collect different data to do the job properly:\n    - What specific geographical area, time period, and demographic was the data sampled from? How does this compare to the deployment use case?\n    - What filters were applied upstream that could leave \"holes\" in the distribution?\n- What fraction of labels are objectively wrong?\n    - Creating accurate labels is a laborious process and humans inevitably make mistakes. It's expensive to check and re-check labels, so most published datasets do contain incorrect labels.\n    - Errors in training set labels can be mitigated through stronger regularization to prevent the model from memorizing the errors, or other techniques.\n    - Most pernicious are errors in **test set** labels. Even a small percentage of these can cause us to select a model that outputs the (objectively mistaken) label over one that does the objectively right thing. The paper [Pervasive Label Errors in Test Sets\nDestabilize Machine Learning Benchmarks](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/f2217062e9a397a1dca429e7d70bc6ca-Paper-round1.pdf) shows that these are more common than you might expect, and describes implications of this in more detail.\n\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "if MAIN:\n    \"TODO: YOUR CODE HERE\"\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## Tokenization\n\nWhen fine-tuning, you need to use the same tokenizer as was used for pre-training. The tokenizer already knows about the 512 token maximum, so it will take care of the truncation if we pass `truncation=True`. We also need to pad out the short reviews with a special padding token. In this case, `tokenizer.pad_token_id` is 0, but it's good practice to not assume this in our code.\n\nIt's most convenient to tokenize the dataset once and store the preprocessed data. Roughly, how large will our preprocessed dataset be?\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution - Train Data Size</summary>\n\nNaively, using int64 the tokens are 25,000 reviews * 512 tokens/review * 8 bytes/token or approximately 104MB. The labels are negligible.\n\nWe know the maximum token value is `tokenizer.vocab_size` or 28996, so it's safe to use int16 instead, decreasing our storage requirements by a factor of 4 to approximately 25MB. We would also expect this data to be very compressible, since there are long strings of padding tokens.\n\n</details>\n\nImplement `to_dataset`. Calling this function could take a minute, as tokenization requires a lot of CPU even with the efficient Rust implementation provided by HuggingFace. We aren't writing our own tokenizer because it would be extremely slow to do it in pure Python.\n\nNote that you really don't want to have to do long-running tasks like this repeatedly. It's always a good idea to store the preprocessed data on disk and load that on future runs. Then you only have to re-run it if you want to preprocess the data in some different way.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def to_dataset(tokenizer, reviews: list[Review]) -> TensorDataset:\n    \"\"\"Tokenize the reviews (which should all belong to the same split) and bundle into a TensorDataset.\n\n    The tensors in the TensorDataset should be (in this exact order):\n\n    input_ids: shape (batch, sequence length), dtype int64\n    attention_mask: shape (batch, sequence_length), dtype int\n    sentiment_labels: shape (batch, ), dtype int\n    star_labels: shape (batch, ), dtype int\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n    train_data = to_dataset(tokenizer, [r for r in reviews if r.split == \"train\"])\n    test_data = to_dataset(tokenizer, [r for r in reviews if r.split == \"test\"])\n    t.save((train_data, test_data), SAVED_TOKENS_PATH)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## Bonus\n\nGo on to Step 2, but if you have time at the end, you can come back and try the bonus exercise for this part.\n\n### Better Truncation\n\nWe arbitrarily kept the first `max_length` tokens and truncated the rest. Is this strategy optimal? If you read some of the reviews, a common pattern is to sum up and conclude the review in the final 1-2 sentences.\n\nThis suggests that we might do better by keeping some number of tokens at the end and truncating the middle instead. Implement this strategy and see if you can measure a difference in accuracy.\n\n### Better Data Cleaning\n\nYou may have noticed that paragraph breaks are denoted by the string \"< br / > < br / >\". We might suppose that these are not very informative, and it would be better to strip them out. Particularly, if we are truncating our reviews then we would rather have 10 tokens of text than this in the truncated sequence. Replace these with the empty string (in all splits of the data) and see if you can measure a difference in accuracy.\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.15"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
