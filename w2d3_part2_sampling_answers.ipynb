It should produce the same output as a for loop around `sample_tokens_with_cache` (up to sampling randomness) but be faster.\n","\n","Hint: refer to the pre-course exercises, in particular `sample_distribution` and the `gather` exercises. You may need to upgrade your cache implementation to support this use case.\n","\n","### Cached Beam Search\n","\n","Write an equivalent of `beam_search` that uses your cache implementation.\n","\n","### PyTorch JIT\n","\n","Learn about PyTorch's [JIT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) and try applying it to your model, and measure the speed increase. It's normal for it to take some fiddling to get it to work.\n","\n","### Top-K and Top-P Together\n","\n","It's possible to use both top-k and top-p at the same time, by implementing them to take logits and return modified logits (and then letting `sample_basic` do the actual sampling). Refactor the implementation to do this. Which order should they be applied in? If you're uncertain, check the [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/generation_utils.py#L3349) implementation to see what they do.\n","\n","</details>\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9 (main, Dec 15 2022, 10:44:50) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)]"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"579b2684d86ca0df9eb99ef90db86ec500bac59b7b51493c9c97f9c9aabc92e6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
