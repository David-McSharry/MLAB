You can build any shape out of sufficiently many triangles and your Pikachu will be made from 412 triangles.\n\nThe camera will emit one or more **rays**, where a ray is represented by an **origin** point and a **direction** point. Conceptually, the ray is emitted from the origin and continues in the given direction until it intersects an object.\n\nWe have no concept of lighting or color yet, so for now we'll say that a pixel on our screen should show a bright color if a ray from the origin through it intersects an object, otherwise our screen should be dark.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"w1d1_ray_tracing.png\"/>\n</p>\n\nTo start, we'll let the z dimension in our `(x, y, z)` space be zero and work in the remaining two dimensions.\n\nImplement the following `make_rays_1d` function so it generates some rays coming out of the origin, which we'll take to be `(0, 0, 0)`.\n\nCalling `render_lines_with_pyplot` on your rays should look like this (note the orientation of the axes):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"w1d1_make_rays_1d.png\" width=\"400\" />\n</p>\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "import os\nimport torch as t\nimport einops\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom ipywidgets import interact\nimport w1d1_test\n\nMAIN = __name__ == \"__main__\"\nIS_CI = os.getenv(\"IS_CI\")\n\n\ndef make_rays_1d(num_pixels: int, y_limit: float) -> t.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    num_pixels: The number of pixels in the y dimension.

If provided, instead of allocating a new tensor and returning that, the output is written directly to the `out` tensor.\n\nIf you used `torch.arange` or `torch.linspace` above, try using the `out` argument. Note that a basic indexing expression like `rays[:, 1, 1]` returns a view that shares storage with `rays`, so writing to the view will modify `rays`. You'll learn more about views later today.\n\n## Ray-Object Intersection\n\nSuppose we have a line segment defined by points $L_1$ and $L_2$. Then for a given ray, we can test if the ray intersects the line segment like so:\n\n- Supposing both the ray and line segment were infinitely long, solve for their intersection point.\n- If the point exists, check whether that point is inside the line segment and the ray.\n\nOur camera ray is defined by the origin $O$ and direction $D$ and our object line is defined by points $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n\nWe can write the equations for all points on the camera ray as $R(u)=O +u D$ for $u \\in [0, \\infty)$ and on the object line as $O(v)=L_1+v(L_2 - L_1)$ for $v \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nThe following interactive widget lets you play with this parameterization of the problem:\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "@interact\ndef line(v=(-2.0, 2.0), seed=(0, 10)):\n    \"\"\"\n    Interactive line widget.\n\n    Drag \"seed\" to get a different random line.\n    Drag \"v\" to see that v must be in [0, 1] for the intersection marked by a star to be \"inside\" the object line.\n    \"\"\"\n    t.manual_seed(seed)\n    L_1 = t.randn(2)\n    L_2 = t.randn(2)\n    P = lambda v: L_1 + v * (L_2 - L_1)\n    (x, y) = zip(P(-2), P(2))\n    plt.plot(x, y, \"g-\")\n    plt.plot(*L_1, \"ro\", markersize=12)\n    plt.plot(*L_2, \"ro\", markersize=12)\n    plt.plot(P(v)[0], P(v)[1], \"*\", markersize=12)\n    plt.xlabel(\"X\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Y\")\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\nSetting the line equations from above equal gives the solution:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}O + u D &= L_1 + v(L_2 - L_1) \\\\ u D - v(L_2 - L_1) &= L_1 - O  \\\\ \\begin{pmatrix} D_x & (L_1 - L_2)_x \\\\ D_y & (L_1 - L_2)_y \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} &=  \\begin{pmatrix} (L_1 - O)_x \\\\ (L_1 - O)_y \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nOnce we've found values of $u$ and $v$ which satisfy this equation, if any (the lines could be parallel) we just need to check that $u \\geq 0$ and $v \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nExercise: for each of the following segments, which camera rays from earlier intersect?

What's one way to achieve this, ignoring efficiency for now?\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Solution - Detecting No Solution</summary>\n\nThe error appears when the matrix is not invertible. We call this a singular matrix, and it's equivalent to a determinant of zero.\n\n`torch.linalg.det` can compute the determinant, and if it's close to zero (allowing for floating point error) then we know there's no solution. One approach would be filtering out those batch elements using a mask, but since this rarely happens it is convenient and not very expensive to just replace that element with something we know is invertible like the identity matrix, and then overwrite the output in that position with False.\n\n</details>\n\n### Tip - Ellipsis\n\nYou can use an ellipsis `...` in an indexing expression to avoid repeated `:' and to write indexing expressions that work on varying numbers of input dimensions.\n\nFor example, `x[..., 0]` is equivalent to `x[:, :, 0]` if `x` is 3D, and equivalent to `x[:, :, :, 0]` if `x` is 4D.\n\n## Tip - Elementwise Logical Operations on Tensors\n\nFor regular booleans, the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` are used to do logical operations and the operators `&`, `|`, and `~` do and, or and not on each bit of the input numbers. For example `0b10001 | 0b11000` is `0b11001` or 25 in base 10.\n\nTragically, Python doesn't allow classes to overload keywords, so if `x` and `y` are of type `torch.Tensor`, then `x and y` does **not** do the natural thing that you probably expect, which is compute `x[i] and y[i]` elementwise. It actually tries to coerce `x` to a regular boolean, which throws an exception.\n\nAs a workaround, PyTorch (and NumPy) have chosen to overload the bitwise operators but have them actually mean logical operations, since you usually don't care to do bitwise operations on tensors. So the correct expression would be `x & y` to compute `x[i] and y[i]` elementwise.\n\n### Tip - Operator Precedence\n\nAnother thing that tragically doesn't do what you would expect is an expression like `v >= 0 & v <= 1`. The operator precedence of `&` is so high that this statement parses as `(v >= (0 & v)) <= 1`.\n\nThe correct expression uses parentheses to force the proper parsing: `(v >= 0) & (v <= 1)`.\n\n### Tip - Logical Reductions\n\nIn plain Python, if you have a list of lists and want to know if any element in a row is `True`, you could use a list comprehension like `[any(row) for row in rows]`. The efficient way to do this in PyTorch is with `torch.any()` or equivalently the `.any()` method of a tensor, which accept the dimension to reduce over. Similarly, `torch.all()` or `.all()` method.\n\nYou can accomplish the same thing with `einops.reduce` but that's more cumbersome.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "def intersect_rays_1d(rays: t.Tensor, segments: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    rays: shape (NR, 2, 3) - NR is the number of rays\n    segments: shape (NS, 2, 3) - NS is the number of segments\n\n    Return: shape (NR, )\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\nif MAIN:\n    w1d1_test.test_intersect_rays_1d(intersect_rays_1d)\n    w1d1_test.test_intersect_rays_1d_special_case(intersect_rays_1d)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## 2D Rays\n\nNow we're going to make use of the z dimension and have rays emitted from the origin in both y and z dimensions.\n\nImplement `make_rays_2d` analogously to `make_rays_1d`.

It's preferable to use a view whenever possible to avoid copying memory unnecessarily. On the other hand, modifying a view modifies the original tensor which can be unintended and surprising. Consult [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_view.html) if you're unsure if a function returns a view. A short reference of common functions:\n\n- `torch.expand`: always returns a view\n- `torch.view`: always returns a view\n- `torch.detach`: always returns a view\n- `torch.repeat`: always copies\n- `torch.clone`: always copies\n- `torch.flip`: always copies (different than numpy.flip which returns a view)\n- `torch.tensor`: always copies, but PyTorch recommends using `.clone().detach()` instead.\n- `torch.Tensor.contiguous`: returns self if possible, otherwise a copy\n- `torch.transpose`: returns a view if possible, otherwise (sparse tensor) a copy\n- `torch.reshape`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy\n- `torch.flatten`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy (different than numpy.flatten which returns a copy)\n- `einops.repeat`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy\n- `einops.rearrange`: returns a view if possible, otherwise a copy\n- Basic indexing returns a view, while advanced indexing returns a copy.\n\n### Storage Objects\n\nCalling `storage()` on a `Tensor` returns a Python object wrapping the underlying C++ array. This array is 1D regardless of the dimensionality of the `Tensor`. This allows you to look inside the `Tensor` abstraction and see how the actual data is laid out in RAM.\n\nNote that a new Python wrapper object is generated each time you call `storage()`, and both `x.storage() == x.storage()` and `x.storage() is x.storage()` evaluates to False.\n\nIf you want to check if two `Tensor`s share an underlying C++ array, you can compare their `storage().data_ptr()` fields. This can be useful for debugging.\n\n### `Tensor._base`\n\nIf `x` is a view, you can access the original `Tensor` with `x._base`. This is an undocumented internal feature that's useful to know. Consider the following code:\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "x = t.zeros(1024*1024*1024)\ny = x[0]\ndel x\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\nHere, `y` was created through basic indexing, so `y` is a view and `y._base` refers to `x`.
