There are other APIs for other hardware like AMD GPUs or Google's TPUs, but the principles are largely the same. A lot of PyTorch consists of CUDA code just like you're going to write today.\n\nToday we'll learn how to write CUDA kernels using the PyCUDA library.  This library allows us to call everything in CUDA, without having to write a bunch of gnarly C/C++ code. Particularly, PyCUDA will take care of initializing the device and cleaning up resources after we're done with them.\n\nCUDA is based on C/C++, and if you haven't written any C/C++ before, this day will be more challenging. I've tried to give context and make things approachable, but don't be afraid to look at solutions and if you're frustrate and not having fun, go do something else!\n\nIn contrast, if you've done a lot of low-level stuff then this day might be too easy - blast through the material and then pick some tricky bonus material to challenge yourself :)\n\nYou will want to install the VS Code extension [Nsight Visual Studio Code Edition](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NVIDIA.nsight-vscode-edition) which provides autocomplete for CUDA files with the `.cu` extension.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Readings](#readings)\n- [CUDA Asserts](#cuda-asserts)\n- [Debugging CUDA - Tips from Ryan Greenblatt, Resident CUDA Expert](#debugging-cuda---tips-from-ryan-greenblatt-resident-cuda-expert)\n- [Running Your First Kernel](#running-your-first-kernel)\n    - [__global__](#global)\n    - [Floating Point Data Types](#floating-point-data-types)\n    - [What does the asterisk mean next to the type?](#what-does-the-asterisk-mean-next-to-the-type)\n    - [No Return Types](#no-return-types)\n    - [`threadidx.x`](#threadidxx)\n    - [const](#const)\n    - [Running the Kernel](#running-the-kernel)\n- [Writing Your First Kernel: A * B + C](#writing-your-first-kernel-a--b--c)\n- [Summing An Array With Atomics](#summing-an-array-with-atomics)\n    - [Multiple Blocks](#multiple-blocks)\n- [Filtering an Array With Atomics](#filtering-an-array-with-atomics)\n- [Indexing](#indexing)\n    - [Error Handling with Printf](#error-handling-with-printf)\n- [Benchmarking](#benchmarking)\n- [Sum of Rows](#sum-of-rows)\n- [Sum of Rows - Performance](#sum-of-rows---performance)\n- [Summing an 1D Array Faster](#summing-an-d-array-faster)\n    - [Block-Level Synchronization](#block-level-synchronization)\n    - [Block-Shared Memory](#block-shared-memory)\n    - [Summing Faster - Multiple Blocks](#summing-faster---multiple-blocks)\n    - [Summing Faster - Multiple Launches](#summing-faster---multiple-launches)\n- [Bonus](#bonus)\n    - [Winograd Convolution](#winograd-convolution)\n    - [Summing Even Faster](#summing-even-faster)\n    - [Warp level Synchronization](#warp-level-synchronization)\n    - [Block Reducing Faster](#block-reducing-faster)\n    - [Filtering Faster Than PyTorch](#filtering-faster-than-pytorch)\n    - [Filtering While Preserving Ordering](#filtering-while-preserving-ordering)\n    - [Reduce-By-Key With Autograd Integration](#reduce-by-key-with-autograd-integration)\n    - [Efficient Matrix Transpose](#efficient-matrix-transpose)\n    - [Pointer Aliasing and `__restrict__`](#pointer-aliasing-and-restrict)\n    - [Reading PyTorch Kernels](#reading-pytorch-kernels)\n    - [Reading Efficient Matrix Multiply on Tensor Cores](#reading-efficient-matrix-multiply-on-tensor-cores)\n    - [Loop Unrolling](#loop-unrolling)\n\n## Readings\n\n- [CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html) - Sections 1 and 2 give some basic context on the differences between CPU and GPU programming.\n\n\n## CUDA Asserts\n\nIf you see the message `CUDA error: device-side assert triggered`, this means there was an error in your kernel but CUDA doesn't want to tell you what it is. You need to restart your notebook or you'll keep seeing this every time you do a CUDA operation.\n\n\n## Debugging CUDA - Tips from Ryan Greenblatt, Resident CUDA Expert\n\nYou can skip reading this section until you have a bug that you are struggling with.\n\nHere's a ordered checklist to go through when debugging cuda (crashes or incorrect output):\n* Reduce to the minimal input. Does this make it obvious what the issue is? Does it fail only when the size isn't a multiple of the block size?\n* Illegal memory error? Make sure to check your allocations are the right size, that pointers are for the correct device, and the bounds on your indexes. If using a notebook or interactive session, you must restart the session after encountering this error to clear the error.\n* Consider adding asserts to validate assumptions about your code - add \"#include <cassert>\" and then use assert(condition).\n* Are things off by a seemingly random amount? Perhaps you failed to initialize to 0 and are using garbage memory.\n* Is the failure/error non-deterministic? The issue could be related to synchronization or reading something while another thread is writing. So look through and try to see if there are any obvious places where synchronization is missing.\n* Think about your algorithm. If there were to be a problem, what section of code is most error-prone or likely to be wrong?\n* Print your inputs, outputs and expected outputs. Use printf strategically within the kernel - the kernel will crash if you print too much because printf has a limited buffer. If print statements upset the timing and cause the issue to no longer occur, try saving values to array and then printing at the end of the kernel. Saving to an array is much faster, so it shouldn't upset timing much.\n* Load your printed data into Python to manipulate it and see if the values make sense at a given point.\n* Call a TA at this point :)\n\nAdvanced: the `cuda-gdb` debugger exists but is sometimes buggy, and we won't go through how to use it here.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "import os\nimport sys\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom typing import Any, Callable\n\nIS_CI = os.getenv(\"IS_CI\")\nif IS_CI:\n    sys.exit(0)\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "Windows users have to do some more work for the compiler toolchain.

CUDA source code is processed by the CUDA compiler using the syntax of C++, with some caveats. If you are a C++ guru, refer to [page 318 of the CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/pdf/CUDA_C_Programming_Guide.pdf) if you're unsure what you can and can't do in CUDA. If not, don't worry - we'll attempt to explain everything you need for the exercises as it comes up.\n\n### __global__\n\nThe `__global__` specifier means the function will be executed on the GPU, and can be called from the GPU or the host. The host refers to your CPU. The alternatives are `__device__` which means the function can only be executed and called from the GPU, and `__host__` which means the function can only be executed and called from the host.\n\n### Floating Point Data Types\n\nThe type `float` is equivalent to `t.float32`. The type `double` is equivalent to `t.float64`. We're going to stick to these two for today.\n\nReduced precision types like `__half` which is like `t.float16` are [more complicated](https://ion-thruster.medium.com/an-introduction-to-writing-fp16-code-for-nvidias-gpus-da8ac000c17f) to play with these, so ignore them for now.\n\n### What does the asterisk mean next to the type?\n\nThe asterisk means that this is actually a memory address, and that the bytes  which refers to one, or more floats. How many floats? In C, you don't get to know this unless you pass the length as a separate argument.\n\n### No Return Types\n\nCUDA kernels always run asynchronously, which means your Python code will start them and then can do something else while they're executing. As such, CUDA kernels never return a value and can only interact with the world by writing to memory.\n\n### `threadidx.x`\n\nWhen you run a CUDA kernel, all the threads run the same function and the only difference is the values they get for the `threadIdx` structure. We'll explain this more as it comes up.\n\n### const\n\nA variable `const i` means that you're not allowed to change `i` after it's defined. `const float *a` means something different - you're not allowed to use the pointer to write to memory.\n\nThe benefits of marking things as `const` are:\n\n- You'll get a compiler error if you try to misuse it\n- In some cases, it enables the compiler to do optimizations for you\n- It makes your code more self-documenting\n\n### Running the Kernel\n\nPyCuda has a concept of a `SourceModule`, which is returned from `load_module`. `SourceModule` takes your source code, compiles it with `nvcc`, and links against the CUDA runtime.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "mod = load_module(\"w1d6_kernels/intro.cu\")\nzero_kernel = mod.get_function(\"zero\")\none_kernel = mod.get_function(\"one\")\ndest = t.ones(128, dtype=t.float32, device=device)\nzero_kernel(Holder(dest), block=(64, 1, 1), grid=(1, 1))\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\nAgain, kernels run asynchronously by default.

For example, it's no problem to store $2^128$ in a Python integer.\n\nIn CUDA as in C, the built-in integer types have fixed sizes and have signed and unsigned variants. The behavior of these types are [exceedingly complicated](https://www.nayuki.io/page/summary-of-c-cpp-integer-rules). Feel free to read the article in detail if you want to be grateful for the convenience of Python's integers. Otherwise, the main take-aways you'll need today are:\n\n- Overflow on an unsigned integer is guaranteed to wrap around.\n- Overflow on a signed integer is \"undefined behavior\", which means the compiler is technically allowed to delete all your files and light your CPU on fire.\n- Implicit conversions area allowed almost everywhere and commonly cause bugs.\n\n\n\nFor CUDA on Windows or Linux, it's safe to assume that `char`, `short`, and `int` are 8, 16, and 32 bits respectively.\n\nFor a long time, 32 bits was plenty to represent the number of elements in a tensor, but GPU memory is increasing and conceivably you might want to operate on individual tensors with billions of elements.\n\nThe most robust approach is to `#include <cstdint>` at the top of your `.cu`, which enables you to use [precisely specified types like](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer) `int64_t`, which is a signed integer of exactly 64 bits regardless of platform. You can convert a value to `int64_t` like this: `static_cast<int64_t>(blockIdx.x)`.\n\nFor today, we won't need to operate on tensors that large, so it's fine to use `int` for counters and lengths. You can also use `int64_t` if you prefer.\n\n### Multiple Blocks\n\nCreate and load a new kernel that takes:\n\n- a float tensor with any shape containing the input to be summed\n- An integer of appropriate type containing the number of elements in the input tensor\n- a scalar float tensor to hold the total.\n\nEach thread should read a value and use [atomicAdd](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#atomic-functions) to add that value to the output element.\n\nCompute the number of blocks necessary to read all elements using `ceil_divide` from the provided utils. Your kernel should check that it isn't reading past the end of the input array. Note that CUDA has no idea about multidimensional tensors; regardless of the number of dimensions in the tensor, CUDA just sees a flattened 1D array.\n\nDue to floating point rounding, the result might not be exactly the same.\n\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "source": "filename = \"w1d6_kernels/sum_atomic.cu\"\nsum_atomic_kernel = load_module(filename).get_function(\"sum_atomic\")\n\n\ndef sum_atomic(inp: t.Tensor, dest: t.Tensor, block_size: int = 1024) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Call sum_atomic_kernel to sum inp into dest.\n\n    inp: shape (*) input to be summed\n    dest: shape ()\n    \"\"\"\n    assert block_size <= 1024\n    pass\n\n\ninp = t.randn(256, 256, 3).to(device=device)\ndest = t.tensor(0.0).to(device=device)\nsum_atomic(inp, dest)\nt.cuda.synchronize()\nexpected = inp.sum()\nactual = dest\nprint(actual, expected)\nutils.allclose_scalar(actual.item(), expected.item())\nprint(\"OK!\")\n\n", "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "\n## Filtering an Array With Atomics\n\nOur next kernel will take a 1D array of floats, a size, a destination array of equal size to the input initialized to zero, a float threshold value, and a 1-element integer tensor called \"counter\" that is initialized to zero.

There are more bonus exercises than you can reasonably complete in a day if this is your first time writing CUDA, so feel free to browse and pick ones that sound exciting!\n\n### Winograd Convolution\n\nMultiple algorithms are known for convolution, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Our earlier implementation of convolution reduced the problem to batch matrix multiplication, which is one legitimate way to do it.\n\nSurprisingly to me, it's possible to do better for convolutions with small filters like 3x3. Shmuel Winograd (not to be confused with the other computer scientist Terry Winograd) showed the way, which you can read about in [Fast Algorithms for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.09308.pdf).\n\nThe real cuDNN implements multiple algorithms including Winograd and one based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Part of what `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark=True` does is test out the various algorithms on the current hardware to see which performs best.\n\nRead about Winograd convolution in the paper and try implementing the basic ideas yourself.\n\n### Summing Even Faster\n\nFirstly, if you have some of your own ideas to optimize your summing kernel, try them out and benchmark!\n\nIf you want to see some other ideas, read [Optimizing Parallel Reduction in CUDA](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf).\n\n### Warp level Synchronization\n\nWe gained speed from coordinating within a block instead of the entire device. The next level is to coordinate at an even more granular level. A warp is a set of 32 threads that can communicate even more quickly using the 'shfl' family of intrinsic functions.\n\nRead [Faster Parallel Reductions on Kepler](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/faster-parallel-reductions-kepler/) through the 'Shuffle Warp Reduce' section, but don't read the 'Block Reduce' as it has spoilers for a later bonus exercise.\n\nThe NVIDIA documentation on [Warp Shuffle Functions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#warp-shuffle-functions) will be useful.\n\nNote that `__shfl_down` has been deprecated and replaced with `__shfl_down_sync`. For the mask input you can just input the full mask: `0xffffffff`.\n\nIntegrate warp functions into your block level summing function, then benchmark!\n\n### Block Reducing Faster\n\nRead the 'Block Reduce' and 'Reducing Layer Arrays' sections of [Faster Parallel Reductions on Kepler](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/faster-parallel-reductions-kepler/).\n\nParticularly take note of the trick of iterating by the total size covered by the grid (blockDim.x * gridDim.x). This is an efficient approach to use only 2 kernel launches without having to tune any parameters.\n\nConsider also reading some of the discussion of atomics in that article and implementing that approach. Combining atomics with block wide reduction results in far fewer atomic collisions while also requiring only one kernel invocation. The overall performance should be similar.\n\n### Filtering Faster Than PyTorch\n\nBenchmark your atomic implementation - performance can vary based on the proportion of floats that pass the filter.\n\nRyan's implementation was able to beat PyTorch by quite a bit, while still being slower than other implementations like [Thrust](https://thrust.github.io/doc/group__stream__compaction_ga695e974946e56f2ecfb20e9ec4fb7cca.html).\n\nIs yours faster? If so, speculate on a reason why (but you aren't likely to get it right unless you've written CUDA before).\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Spoiler - Filtering</summary>\n\nPyTorch does enforce that the input ordering is retained, which makes the problem a bit harder.\n\nBeyond that, Ryan claimed that the compiler detected that [Warp-Aggregated Atomics](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-optimized-filtering-warp-aggregated-atomics/) could be safely used, which reduces the number of atomics by up to 32 times - the threads in a warp coordinate and only one thread has to atomically increase the counter.\n\n</details>\n\n### Filtering While Preserving Ordering\n\nThe PyTorch implementation uses an \"exclusive scan\" approach. The idea is to compute an array `temp` with an array of 1 where the corresponding input element does pass the predicate, and 0 otherwise. Exclusive scan is an operation similar to `cumsum`, and after running this, `temp[i]` contains the number of items before index `i` that have passed the predicate. Finally, for each `i`, you can use `temp[i]` to determine the index into `dest` where `input[i]` should be copied. Try it out!\n\nAdvanced: you can use `shfl` operations to do scan within a warp. See [Inclusive plus-scan](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/#warp-examples-inclusive) for an example, though note that exclusive scan is slightly different.\n\n### Reduce-By-Key With Autograd Integration\n\nPyTorch doesn't provide the \"reduce-by-key\" scatter operation, but it is a handy one to have. The operation is included in the library [PyTorch-Scatter](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/scatter.html) and the link has a nice diagram describing it.\n\nTry implementing it using device-wide atomics to get a correct, but slow implementation.\n\nTo backprop through your new operation, you'll need to subclass `Function` from PyTorch and define the backward pass, similarly to what you did in W1D3. See [Extending PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html) for documentation on doing this.\n\nNote the backward pass can be implemented with just PyTorch built-ins; you won't need a separate kernel for the backwards pass.\n\nA reference implementation you can look at is the one in [Thrust](https://thrust.github.io/doc/group__reductions_gad5623f203f9b3fdcab72481c3913f0e0.html).\n\n\n### Efficient Matrix Transpose\n\nFollow along with the blog post [An Efficient Matrix Transpose in CUDA C/C++](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/efficient-matrix-transpose-cuda-cc/) and gain a better understanding of the performance implications of shared memory.\n\n### Pointer Aliasing and `__restrict__`\n\nFollow along with the blog post [CUDA Pro Tip: Optimize for Pointer Aliasing](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-optimize-pointer-aliasing/). The article is old at this point - see how much difference using `__restrict__` makes on modern GPUs.\n\n### Reading PyTorch Kernels\n\nHave a look in the PyTorch source tree at some real production kernels. Many can be found under [aten/src/ATen/native/cuda](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda). Try to understand how they balance performance with maintainability and support for many different dtypes.\n\nSadly, most of NVIDIA's kernels are closed source so we can't tell what they're doing in there.\n\n### Reading Efficient Matrix Multiply on Tensor Cores\n\n[NVIDIA Cutlass](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/12f4108ac2233022b92f0e3533c23bed399fcf45/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md) is an open source implementation of various linear algebra functions.\n\nRead at the link about what's needed to make matrix multiply fast on Tensor Cores.\n\n### Loop Unrolling\n\nIn theory, the compiler should perform loop unrolling for you when applicable, but in practice it often doesn't. Try manually unrolling some of your loops and see if you can measure a performance difference. Or, inspect the generated code and see if you can see a difference there.\n\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.15"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
